title: a lesson in being nice.

today at work, a man came in an bought a quart of oil.

he asked if we had a light he could borrow.

being the nice fellow I am, I immediately pulled out my penlight and handed it to him. 

in my head, there was an understanding that my penlight would be returned to me.

a short while later, he asked for disposable funnel with which to pour his new oil. 

I informed him we did not offer disposable funnels, but instead a single plastic funnel which he may use and return when finished.

after he walked back to his vehicle, I watched him get in and drive away. with my penlight, and with our funnel.

I was rather fond of that penlight, and I am deeply saddened by my loss of the penlight. 

I'll go buy another penlight, I'm sure. it wasn't super expensive.

but it really hurts when people take your things, doesn't it?

I spent a good while trying to find and save money to buy that penlight.

but if another person, or even the same person, asks me to borrow a light?

I'll let them.

because it's nice.
