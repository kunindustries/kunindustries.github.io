Well, we like to believe we're pretty tech savvy. Why not let us prove it to you, and at a fair price?

# Hardware

## Custom Builds
If you can supply the parts, we can build systems for you.

- Full Size Desktop
  - this is any full sized desktop computer. you supply us with the parts (or money to buy the parts), and we'll slap it together for you and make sure it works. if you want, we'll even go ahead and install any software you want on it before handing it back over to you\*, at no charge.
- Raspberry Pi builds
  - we will also put together purpose built raspberry pi equipment. perhaps you want a dedicated server cluster for your TeamSpeak server, or maybe a simple cloud file host for you local network. same story here, just give us the parts (or the money, lebowski) and we'll put it together for you. we'll also write detailed instructions on how to use the equipment, and we will provide support for the equipment for no less than one (1) year after build.
  
  Pricing for all builds is a $25 down payment, as well as the cost of parts\*\*.

## Repair
We can repair most personal computing devices like laptops and desktops. Obviously, we don't have a list of every single computer we can work on, but generally we can service most desktops and laptops.

Pricing is simply what we had to spend to fix it. Tools if we needed them, and parts.

# Software Development
Do you have a great idea for an app or game?  
Do you need someone to finish your Computer Science project?  
Do you need to replace a system with something more modern?  

Look no further than the Kun Industries Technology Services Software Development team. We'll build that shit for you right on the spot, as long as you spot me some cash.  

We can develop software for:
- The Web
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
- Windows
  - Windows 8
  - Windows 10
- Linux
  - Mint
  - Raspbian

# Misc. Services
## Recycling
When we say "recycling," what we really mean is "give us your old junk." It doesn't even have to work, if it's tech related we want it. We'll figure out something we can do with it.

## Computer Make-Fast
- bloat removal
- storage cleanup
- optimisation

\* You have to own the software, we will not illegally install it for you.  
\*\* Sum of the cost of all parts required to complete the build. <!-- we might already have the parts, but not have the money to sustain business, and so have to charge -->
