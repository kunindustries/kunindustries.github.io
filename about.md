The primary mission of Kun Industries is to make the world better for everyone. Quality and respect are our most important values. We offer many [services](https://kunindustries.com/services/), many of which completely unrelated.

Kun Industries was founded in 2016, following the release of the [Executives and Other Criminals update for Grand Theft Auto V](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/GTA_Online:_Executives_and_Other_Criminals).
